## Partition List

Given a linked list and a value x, partition it such that all nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

### Test Cases

head = [1, 4, 3, 2, 5, 2], x = 3 -> [1, 2, 2, 4, 3, 5]
