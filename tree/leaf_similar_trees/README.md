## Leaf Similar Trees

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree.  From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a leaf value sequence.

Two binary trees are considered leaf-similar if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return true if and only if the two given trees with head nodes root1 and root2 are leaf-similar.

### Test Cases

root1 = [3, 5, 1, 6, 2, 9, 8, null, null, 7, 4]
root2 = [3, 5, 1, 6, 7, 4, 2, null, null, null, null, null, null, 9, 8]
output = true
