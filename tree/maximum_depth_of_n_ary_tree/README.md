## Maximum Depth of N-ary Tree

Given a n-ary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

### Test Cases

root = [1, null, 3, 2, 4, null, 5, 6] -> 3

root = [1, null, 2, 3, 4, 5, null, null, 6, 7, null, 8, null, 9, 10, null, null, 11, null, 12, null, 13, null, null, 14] -> 5
