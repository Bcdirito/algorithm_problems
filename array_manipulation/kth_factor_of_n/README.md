## First Unique Character in a String
Given two positive integers n and k.

A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

### Test Cases

n = 12, k = 3 -> 3

n = 7, k = 2 -> 7

n = 4, k = 4 -> -1

n = 1, k = 1 -> 1

n = 1000, k = 3 -> 4
