## Single Element in a Sorted Array:

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Follow up: Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

### Test Cases
nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8] -> 2

nums = [3, 3, 7, 7, 10, 11, 11] -> 10
