## Tribonacci
Tribonacci is much the same as Fibonacci, except you add the last 3 elements as opposed to the last 2 elements.

Given an array of 3 elements (signature), and a non-negative length(n), return an array with length n of Tribonacci numbers.

### Test Cases

[0, 1, 2], 3 -> [0, 1, 2]

[0, 1, 2], 4 -> [0, 1, 2, 2]

[12, 18, 27], 0 -> []

[1, 1, 1], 2 -> [1, 1]
