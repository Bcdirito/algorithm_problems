## Range Sum of BST

Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

### Test Cases

root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15 -> 32

root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10 -> 23
