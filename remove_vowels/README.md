## Remove Vowels Algorithm
Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

Note: for this algorithm "y" isn't considered a vowel.

### Test Cases

"I love vowels" -> " lv vwls"

"Try try try" -> "Try try try"

"Welcome to the thunderdome" -> "Wlcm t th thndrdm"
