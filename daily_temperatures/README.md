## Longest Unique Substring Algorithm

Given a list of daily temperatures T, return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put 0 instead.


### Test Cases

T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73] -> [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0].
