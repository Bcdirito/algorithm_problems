## Unique in Order Algorithm

Implement the algorithm which takes as argument a sequence and returns a list of items without any elements with the same value next to each other and preserving the original order of elements.

### Test Cases

"aaaabbbbccccddddeeee" -> ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
"abcabcabc" -> ["a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c", "a", "b", "c"]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1]
